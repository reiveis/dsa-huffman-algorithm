Viterbi School of Engineering, Dept. of Computer Science
December 27th, 2021

    I dreamt of a new reality: a virtual reality that cannot be distinguished from its real counterpart.  But before I can take the first step of realizing that dream, I would need to have a great understanding of computing logic and graphics. And at the Viterbi School of Engineering, Computer Science Games provide the best of both worlds. USC offers a lot of things but two things, in particular, attracted me to USC: classes and research opportunities.
    USC provides classes that are complete for my goal of creating a seamless reality. Other than math and physics, this major also covers graphics, networking, and game engine and gameplay programming as mentioned by an alumnus. I believe that these skills are essential for me to build a solid foundation in understanding logical operations and visualization; at the same time, it will also prepare me to be an industry-standard graduate. On that note, I look forward to attending classes from prominent lecturers such as Randall Hill and Jonathan Gratch as their experienced insights are beneficial in real-life situations.
    In addition to the classes that USC provides, the Institute of Creative Technologies is also one of the prominent factors for my eagerness to study at USC. This research institute offers undergraduates research opportunities to work together with bright minds across multidisciplinary majors to create virtual experiences that mimic reality. Especially with their work on real-time avatars using dynamic textures had really intrigued me with the possibilities of mixed reality through the use of smartphones.
